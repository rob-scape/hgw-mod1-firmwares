 # Mod1 LFO
 Multi waveform LFO.\
 Instead of SawRevWave a random slope is used as 5th waveform. 
 SawRevWave is still in the code if you want to return to Hagiwos original code.\
 Selectable waveforms: Sine, Triangle, Square, Saw, Random Slope, MaxTable waveforms.  
 
- Pot1 → frequency
- Pot2 → waveform select
- Pot3 → output level
- F1 → frequency CV in
- F2 → waveform CV in
- F3 → output level CV in
- F4 → output
- BUTTON → change frequency range
- LED → output
- EEPROM → Saves the frequency range when the button is pressed
 
 # 3chan LFO
 Three channel LFO.\
 Added a fourth waveform: Random slope.\
 Selectable waveforms: Triangle, Square, Sine, Random Slope chosen by a push button on D4.
 
- Pot1 → LFO1 frequency

 # randomwalk
Random Walk with Gravity Mode.\
Button toggles between classic Random Walk mode and Gravity Mode.\
Gravity Mode pulls the output slowly back to 0 over time.

Slow, evolving CV signals, offering both chaotic and stabilized output behaviors. 

Rate, Bias/Offset, ChaosDepth can be controlled via pots. CV ins for Rate and ChaosDepth.

Classic Random Walk Mode: Generates smooth, random CV output with adjustable step size.\
Gravity Mode: Adds a gradual pull back to zero, creating a drifting, self-centering effect.

- Pot1 → Rate / Control the frequency of random steps.    
- Pot2 → Bias/Offset /Shifts the output up or down.
- Pot3 → ChaosDepth (step size of walk) / Adjust the step size from subtle drifts to wild jumps.
- Button → switch mode
- F1 → CV input / adds to Rate
- F3 → CV input / adds to ChaosDepth 
- F4 → Random Walk Output

 # bezier curve with spike jitter mode
Bezier curve random CV generator by Hagiwo adapted for Mod1 and added a second Spike/Jitter Bezier mode, accesible via button.

Smooth random CV source with additional spike and jitter mode.

Spike, jitter probability and spike length can be fine tuned in code.  I think i settled for nicely erratic not too random values in the spike mode.   

- Pot1 → freq
- Pot2 → curve
- Pot3 → dev
- F1 → freq CV in
- F2 → curve CV in
- F3 → dev CV in
- F4 → output
- LED → Pin 3
- Button → switch modes


 # sample and hold with slew
 Classical sample and hold function. Sample and hold output on F4, triggered by button or F1 trigger input.\
 If nothing is patched into sample input F2 an internal sample source is used.
 
 Pot1 is a bias for the internal noise.\
 In the middle position truly random, fully clockwise shifts towards higher values, fully counter clockwise shifts towards lower values.
 
 Pot3  is gain/level.
 
 Sample and hold output on F4\
 Slewed output on F3 with Pot 2 controling time constant of the slew, up to 1000 ms slew.
 
 - Pot1 → A0 noise bias
 - Pot2 → A1 time constant slew
 - Pot3 → A2 gain
-  F1 → A3 trigger in
-  F2 → A4 sample input
-  F3 → A5 slew output
-  F4 → D11 sample and hold output
-  LED → Pin 3
-  Button → Pin 4 trigger
 
 # Enhanced Bernoulli Gate and Loop Sequencer with glitch bursts
This firmware combines a probabilistic Bernoulli gate with a step sequencer, providing flexible trigger manipulation and glitchy bursts for
randomness, controlled probabilities, and rhythmic chaos.

Route incoming triggers to either of the two outputs. The decision is random, with a controllable amount of randomness/ probability (pot1 + CV input).

In Step Sequence Modes, pressing the button generates a new randomized sequence. 4-Step, 8-Step, 32-Step Sequence.

With pot3 you can introduce Miss Probability and Glitch Bursts.


This combination of probability control, step sequencing, trigger skipping, and glitch bursts makes the module versatile for generative rhythms, random variations, and chaotic textures. 

Controls:\
Pot 1 Probability\
Sets the probability of switching between the two outputs (F3 and F4).\
Fully counterclockwise: Always output F3.\
Fully clockwise: Always output F4.\
Intermediate positions introduce a random chance of either output based on the pot setting.

Pot 2 Mode/Length\
Selects between Bernoulli Mode and Step Sequence Modes:\
0-20% (CCW): Bernoulli Mode\
20-40%: 4-Step Sequence\
40-60%: 8-Step Sequence\
60-80%: 16-Step Sequence\
80-100% (CW): 32-Step Sequence\
In Step Sequence Modes, pressing the button generates a new randomized sequence.

Pot 3 Miss Probability and Glitch Burst\
Sets the probability of skipping triggers:\
Fully counterclockwise: No triggers are missed.\
Turn clockwise: Up to 35% of triggers are missed. Linear 0-35%.\
80-100% (CW): Introduces Glitch Bursts, where rapid chaotic trigger sequences are generated occasionally.

Inputs and Outputs:\
F1 Trigger Input\
Incoming trigger signal to be processed through the Bernoulli gate or sequencer.

F2 CV Input\
Modulates the output probability in conjunction with Pot 1, allowing CV control.

F3 Output 1\
One of the two output trigger channels, chosen based on the current probability setting.

F4 Output 2\
The second output trigger channel, acting as a counterpart to F3.

Button\
Pressing the button in Sequence Mode regenerates the step sequence with a new randomized pattern.
In Bernoulli Mode, the button has no effect.

LED Indicator\
Flashes on every valid trigger output (either F3 or F4).

  
# pot1 recorder 

Pot1 Recorder with Fast PWM Output (100 Hz S&H style) max recording time 7.5 sec.\
S&H style recording and playback in order to squeeze out a useful recording time of the nano’s small SRAM.

You can record movement of pot1 while holding down the button. Once let go it will loop the recording.

Pot2 is speed, from half to double speed.\
Pot3 is gain control.

# Turing Machine, Klee-style sequencer with quantized and unquantized CV out

This firmware turns your Mod1 into a Turing Machine / Klee-style sequencer with quantized and unquantized CV out.

It generates evolving or locked step sequences using a shift register, modulated by a randomness knob and/ or CV with slip, lock, and random modes.

Loop length and output range are controllable via pots.

Musical scales are selectable via a button for the quantized output.

Great for random, looped and evolving melodies and patterns.

Pot1 → Main sequencing pot (random/ slip/ lock)\
At noon, the sequences are random.\
At 5 o'clock, it locks into a repeating sequence.\
At 7 o'clock, it double locks into a repeating sequence twice as long as the 'length' setting.\
At 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock, it slips; looping but occasionally changing notes.

Pot2 → Loop length\
Pot3 → Range/ gain\
F1 → Trigger in\
F2 → CV in offset for pot1\
F3 → Quantized CV output\
F4 → CV output\
BUTTON → change scale for quantized output\


# Lorenz System

Lorenz Attractors are great for organic, non-repeating CV movement, chaotic but not random.  
This system inspired the popular 'butterfly effect' metaphor, where small changes can lead 
to dramatically different outcomes.”

Pots:\
  A0 → Sigma (flow strength / controls how fast x and y try to equalize/ also mapped to stepSize\
  A1 → Rho   (divergence / higher = stronger pull from center -> more chaos, from calm to chaos)\
  A2 → Beta  (damping / controls how sharply z grows or decays)

Input:\
F1 (A3 / D17) → Trigger input (resets attractor on rising edge)

Outputs:\
  D9 (F2)  → x axis (PWM CV)\
  D10 (F3) → y axis (PWM CV)\
  D11 (F4) → z axis (PWM CV)

Button (D4) → toggle normal and slow mode\
LED (D3)    → Blinks in stepsize
